Towards A Swarm of Agile Micro Quadrotors
  * http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss08/p28.pdf
  * MIQP for trajectory in teams
  * Optimization: team split up in groups; environment split in sub-regions
  * suboptimal results in seconds; optimal result 20min
  * Space was devided in two regions and 8 vehicles (exploiting symmetry of configuration)
  * full 3d trajectories w/ advanced kinematic constraints


//
1. Formation flight/reconfiguration => extension to 3d?
2. warehouse-like dynamic requests => pick k out of n possible goals; where each goal has priority assigned
3.
